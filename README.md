This report presents four laboratory assignments
exploring fundamental artificial intelligence algorithms and their
practical implementations. The first assignment investigates state
space search through the Rabbit Leap and Missionaries &
Cannibals problems, comparing Breadth-First Search (BFS) and
Depth-First Search (DFS) performance and optimality. The sec-
ond assignment implements A* search for plagiarism detection,
demonstrating optimal text alignment with minimal edit distance.
The third assignment focuses on SAT solving, featuring a random
k-SAT instance generator and comparative analysis of heuristic
search algorithms including Hill-Climbing, Beam Search, and
Variable-Neighborhood Descent across different problem com-
plexities. The fourth assignment applies Simulated Annealing to
image reconstruction and melodic composition, solving scram-
bled jigsaw puzzles and generating Raag Bhairav-compliant
melodies. Collectively, these experiments provide insights into
search algorithm characteristics, efficiency trade-offs, and real-
world applicability across diverse problem domains including
puzzle solving, text analysis, logical reasoning, and creative
generation.
