This report presents four laboratory assignments exploring fundamental artificial intelligence algorithms and their practical implementations. The first assignment investigates state space search through the Rabbit Leap and Missionaries & Cannibals problems, comparing Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) performance and optimality. The second assignment implements A* search for plagiarism detection, demonstrating optimal text alignment with minimal edit distance. The third assignment focuses on SAT solving, featuring a random k-SAT instance generator and comparative analysis of heuristic search algorithms including Hill-Climbing, Beam Search, and Variable-Neighborhood Descent across different problem com- plexities. The fourth assignment applies Simulated Annealing to image reconstruction, solving scrambled jigsaw puzzles. Collectively, these experiments provide insights into search algorithm characteristics, efficiency trade-offs, and real- world applicability across diverse problem domains including puzzle solving, text analysis, logical reasoning, and creative generation.
